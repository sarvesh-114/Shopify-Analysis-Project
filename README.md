# Shopify-Analysis-Project
Welcome to my end-to-end Data Analytics project, where I dove deep into a Shopify sales dataset to explore trends, clean data, store it in a database, and build some cool dashboards to visualize insights.  This project was all about turning raw order data into meaningful, business-driven insights using Python, MySQL, and Power BI.
